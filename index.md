Hello and welcome to this blog, which is actually not a blog. I'm just setting this up and do not think that I'll have much to say, but it is nice to try things out...

If I understood correctly from [this posting](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1221099494185422849), eventual jupyter notebooks in the `notebook` directory could be turned into a blog post. 

## This is a title

Posts would appear after this text, they say. We'll see...
